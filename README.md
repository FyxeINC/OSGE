# OSRL
An Open Source Roguelike that I'm developing intermittently in my spare time.

## Resources Used
- [Console Renderer](https://github.com/NinovanderMark/ConsoleRenderer), a great library for displaying graphics in console for C#
- [Google](www.google.com), for console window utilties such as Maximizing on startup.
